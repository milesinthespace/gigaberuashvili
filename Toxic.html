<p> <h4> “Toxic productivity”, the latest byword for extortion under capitalism, really does seem to be cropping up in a lot of places right now. If you haven't noticed it yet, you’ll undoubtedly find it in a TikTok, tweet  or infographic any day now. Even Jordan Peterson, “custodian of the patriarchy”, has been getting in on the action.  The basic premise is that many of us suffer from a quasi-medical condition that forces us to spend all our time working while failing to devote enough time for rest and leisure. It has been described as an  “unhealthy desire to be  productive at all times, at all costs…. The need to go the ‘extra mile’ even when it's not expected of you”. According to the tenets of toxic productivity, we work too much not because we need the money or due to any external pressures (in fact, much of the writing on the subject is keen to exonerate the influence of employers), but because we have brought it on ourselves through our own disordered thinking.  “Often the ‘toxic productivity’ discussion focuses on individual behaviours or attitudes,” explains Amelia Horgan,  academic and author of the forthcoming book Lost in Work: Escaping Capitalism. “There are certainly people who might describe themselves as suffering from this. I don't think they're necessarily wrong,  and descriptions like this can be really helpful to individual people in making sense of their stress at work.But I think a focus on individual attitude is looking in the wrong place. If there are harms that come from this way of relating to ourselves, to each other and time, and I think there are, then we need to take them more seriously than expecting we can wish them away through thinking alone. We should really be asking where these attitudes come from.  As with ‘burnout’, reaching for these labels can sometimes smoothe away the background conditions that cause them by  presenting them as a personal medical problem that is easy to fix.”</h4></p>
