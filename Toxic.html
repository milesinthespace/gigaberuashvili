<h3>Toxic Productivity Has Arrived At the Scene </h3>

<p> <h4> “Toxic productivity”, the latest byword for extortion under capitalism, really does seem to be cropping up <br>in a lot of places right now. If you haven't noticed it yet, you’ll undoubtedly find it in a TikTok, tweet <br> or infographic any day now. Even Jordan Peterson, “custodian of the patriarchy”, has been getting in on the action. <br> The basic premise is that many of us suffer from a quasi-medical condition that forces us to spend all our time <br> working while failing to devote enough time for rest and leisure. It has been described as an  “unhealthy desire to be <br> productive at all times, at all costs…. The need to go the ‘extra mile’ even when it's not expected of you”. <br> According to the tenets of toxic productivity, we work too much not because we need the money <br> or due to any external pressures (in fact, much of the writing on the subject is keen to exonerate the influence of employers), <br> but because we have brought it on ourselves through our own disordered thinking. <br> “Often the ‘toxic productivity’ discussion focuses on individual behaviours or attitudes,” explains Amelia Horgan, <br> academic and author of the forthcoming book Lost in Work: Escaping Capitalism. <br>“There are certainly people who might describe themselves as suffering from this. I don't think they're necessarily wrong, <br> and descriptions like this can be really helpful to individual people in making sense of their stress at work. <br> But I think a focus on individual attitude is looking in the wrong place. If there are harms that come from this way of <br>relating to ourselves, to each other and time, and I think there are, then we need to take them more seriously <br>than expecting we can wish them away through thinking alone. We should really be asking where these attitudes come from. <br> As with ‘burnout’, reaching for these labels can sometimes smoothe away the background conditions that cause them by <br> presenting them as a personal medical problem that is easy to fix.”</h4></p>
