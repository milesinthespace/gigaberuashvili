<p><h4>Studio Ghibli, the legends responsible for gracing our drab world with animated classics like Spirited Away, have given us another look inside their forthcoming theme park. And it looks just as magical as you’d expect. 
This time, the concept art has been revealed for the My Neighbour Totoro-themed area of the park, giving us  our best look yet at how they plan to bring the iconic movie into the real world. The illustration, drawn in traditional Ghibli style, shows the park with several streams running through it, just like the one that Mei and  Satsuki stare into in the original movie.

A replica of Mei and Satsuki’s countryside home has been a part of the Expo Aichi Commemorative Park near Nagoya, Central Japan, where the theme park will be located, for years now. But now it will be joined by a life-sized  Cat Bus and a gigantic replica of the tree Totoro perches on top of in one of the movie’s iconic scenes. 
The preview was revealed to excited Ghibli stans across the world following a press conference from the Aichi prefectural government, who announced the land was finally under construction.

It will be joined by several other themed lands in the park tied to other Studio Ghibli movies, including (but not limited to): <em>Kiki’s Delivery Service, Howl’s Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke</em> and their latest 3D venture, <em>Earwig and the Witch.</em> </h4> </p>
