<p><h4>Studio Ghibli, the legends responsible for gracing our drab world with animated classics like Spirited Away,<br> have given us another look inside their forthcoming theme park. And it looks just as magical as you’d expect. 
<br>This time, the concept art has been revealed for the My Neighbour Totoro-themed area of the park, giving us <br> our best look yet at how they plan to bring the iconic movie into the real world. The illustration, drawn in <br> traditional Ghibli style, shows the park with several streams running through it, just like the one that Mei and <br> Satsuki stare into in the original movie.
<br>
A replica of Mei and Satsuki’s countryside home has been a part of the Expo Aichi Commemorative Park near <br>Nagoya, Central Japan, where the theme park will be located, for years now. But now it will be joined by a life-sized <br> Cat Bus and a gigantic replica of the tree Totoro perches on top of in one of the movie’s iconic scenes. 
<br>The preview was revealed to excited Ghibli stans across the world following a press conference from the Aichi prefectural <br>government, who announced the land was finally under construction.

It will be joined by several other themed lands in <br> the park tied to other Studio Ghibli movies, including (but not limited to): <em>Kiki’s Delivery Service, Howl’s Moving Castle, <br>Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke</em> and their latest 3D venture, <em>Earwig and the Witch.</em> </h4> </p>
